Heptagon Construction and Field Extension Theory

Overview

An exploration of the geometric and algebraic constraints of constructing a regular heptagon, comparing classic Straightedge and Compass limitations with Neusis Construction and Cyclotomic Polynomials.
Mathematical Depth
•	Constructible Numbers: Algebraic proof that $\cos(2\pi/7)$ belongs to a field extension of degree 3, making it non-constructible via classic methods (which require degrees of $2^n$).
•	Cyclotomic Analysis: Implementation of roots of unity for $x^7 - 1 = 0$.
•	Field Theory: Demonstrates mastery of degree of extensions and minimal polynomials.
